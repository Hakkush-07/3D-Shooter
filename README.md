# 3D-Shooter using pygame
A basic 3D Shooter game made with pygame.
I know that python and pygame are not convenient for this kind of work but I wondered how they display 3d things on a 2d screen.
I used spherical coordinates to deal with rotation.

Simple version with more systematic coding: [pygame-3D](https://github.com/Hakkush-07/pygame-3D)
